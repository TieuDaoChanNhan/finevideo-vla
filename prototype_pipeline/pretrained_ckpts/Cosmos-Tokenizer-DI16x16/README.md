# **Cosmos Tokenizer**: A suite of image and video tokenizers

[**Website**](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-tokenizer) | [**Code**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer) | [**Video**](https://youtu.be/Soy_myOfWIU)


# Model Overview

## Description:
**Cosmos Tokenizer** is a suite of visual tokenizers for images and videos that delivers various compression rates while maintaining high reconstruction quality. Cosmos Tokenizer can serve as an effective and efficient building block in both diffusion-based and autoregressive models for image and video generation.


Our tokenizers come in two types: **Continuous** (C) and **Discrete** (D), each with **Image** (I) and **Video** (V) variants:
* Continuous tokenizers encode visual data into continuous latent embeddings, as shown in latent diffusion models like [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion). These embeddings are suitable for models that generate data by sampling from continuous distributions. 
* Discrete tokenizers encode visual data into discrete latent codes, mapping them into quantized indices, as seen in autoregressive transformers such as [VideoPoet](https://sites.research.google/videopoet/). This discretization is required for models that generate data by optimizing the cross-entropy loss, such as the GPT models.


|                   | Continuous ( C )    | Discrete ( D )      |
| ------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Images ( I )**        | Cosmos-Tokenizer-CI            | Cosmos-Tokenizer-DI            |
| **Videos ( V )**        | Cosmos-Tokenizer-CV            | Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV            |


Given an image or a video, Cosmos Tokenizer outputs either continuous latents or discrete tokens. Cosmos Tokenizer achieves spatial compression rates of 8x8 or 16x16 and temporal compression factors of 4x or 8x, resulting in a total compression factor of up to 2048x (=8x16x16). Cosmos Tokenizer delivers 8x more total compression than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while simultaneously maintaining higher image quality and running up to 12x faster than the best available SOTA tokenizers.

## Model Architecture: 

We designed Cosmos Tokenizer using a lightweight and computationally efficient architecture, featuring a temporally causal design. Specifically, we employ causal temporal convolution and causal temporal attention layers to preserve the natural temporal order of video frames, ensuring seamless tokenization of images and videos using a single unified network architecture. The encoder and decoder form a symmetrical pair, which are mirrors of each other. The encoder starts with a 2-level [Haar wavelet](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-04295-4) transform layer, which down-samples inputs by a factor of 4 in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Likewise, the decoder ends with an inverse wavelet transform. We employ the vanilla autoencoder (AE) formulation to model the latent space for continuous tokenizers. For discrete tokenizers, we adopt the [Finite-Scalar-Quantization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8ishA3LxN8) (FSQ) as the latent space quantizer.

# Usage
Inference Engines: 
* [Cosmos-Tokenizer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer) (PyTorch)
* [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)

## Inference with `Cosmos-Tokenizer` (PyTorch)
### Step-1: Installation of `Cosmos-Tokenizer` 
Note: Currently, the `Cosmos-Tokenizer` code is only supported on Linux.

- Please clone the `Cosmos-Tokenizer` from GitHub repo [github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer.git
    cd Cosmos-Tokenizer
    ```
- Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    apt-get install -y ffmpeg
    ```

- Preferably, you could build a docker image using our provided Dockerfile.
    ```bash
    docker build -t cosmos-docker -f Dockerfile.    
    # You can run the container as:
    docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v /home/${USER}:/home/${USER} \
        --workdir ${PWD} cosmos-docker /bin/bash
    ```

### Step-2: Download Pre-trained Checkpoints
- Create a local directory for the pre-trained checkpoints and download the 
pre-trained checkpoints from HuggingFace.

    ```python
    from huggingface_hub import login, snapshot_download
    import os
    # You could get your Hugging Face token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
    login(token=<YOUT-HF-TOKEN>, add_to_git_credential=True)
    # You could specify the tokenizers you want to download.
    model_names = [
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-CI8x8",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-CI16x16",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-CV4x8x8",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-CV8x8x8",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-CV8x16x16",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-DI8x8",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-DI16x16",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV4x8x8",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV8x8x8",
            "Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV8x16x16",
    ]
    for model_name in model_names:
        hf_repo = "nvidia/" + model_name
        local_dir = "pretrained_ckpts/" + model_name
        os.makedirs(local_dir, exist_ok=True)
        print(f"downloading {model_name} to {local_dir}...")
        snapshot_download(repo_id=hf_repo, local_dir=local_dir)
    ```

- Under the ech checkpoint directory `pretrained_ckpts/<model-name>`, we provide the encoder, 
decoder and the full autoencoder JIT models.

    ```bash 
    ├── pretrained_ckpts/   
    │   ├── Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV8x8x8/
    │   │   ├── encoder.jit
    │   │   ├── decoder.jit
    │   │   ├── autoencoder.jit
    │   ...
    ```

### Step-3: Run Inference
You can use the following example commands to encode and decode images or videos. For each, the same command works for both continuous and discrete tokenization. Simply provide the proper JIT-compiled ckpt to `checkpoint_enc`, `checkpoint_dec`, or the full autoencoder ckpt to `checkpoint`.

```python
import torch
from cosmos_tokenizer.image_lib import ImageTokenizer

model_name = "Cosmos-Tokenizer-DI8x8"
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 512, 512).to('cuda').to(torch.bfloat16)  # [B, C, H, W]
encoder = ImageTokenizer(checkpoint_enc=f'pretrained_ckpts/{model_name}/encoder.jit')
(indices,codes) = encoder.encode(input_tensor)
torch.testing.assert_close(indices.shape, (1, 64, 64))
torch.testing.assert_close(codes.shape, (1, 6, 64, 64))

# The input tensor can be reconstructed by the decoder as:
decoder = ImageTokenizer(checkpoint_dec=f'pretrained_ckpts/{model_name}/decoder.jit')
reconstructed_tensor = decoder.decode(indices)
torch.testing.assert_close(reconstructed_tensor.shape, input_tensor.shape)
```

The `indices` will have the shape `(1, 64, 64)` and contain integral values in the range `[1..64K]`.
The `codes` will contain the pre-quantization continuous latent with shape `(1, 6, 64, 64)`, where `C=6` represents the number of FSQ levels.


**Note**: More inference usage commands, including both TorchScript (JIT) and PyTorch Inference APIs on real images and videos, can be found on our GitHub repository [github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos-Tokenizer).


## Inference with NeMo

### Step-1: Install NeMo
Please install NeMo from the GitHub `main` branch following the instructions [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo?tab=readme-ov-file#pip-from-a-source-branch).

### Step-2: Run Inference
Run the following code to tokenize the video:

```python
import torch
from nemo.collections.common.video_tokenizers.cosmos_vision_tokenizer import CausalVideoTokenizer
model_name = "Cosmos-Tokenizer-DI8x8"
model = CausalVideoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 512, 512).to('cuda').to(torch.bfloat16)
(indices, codes) = model.encode(input_tensor)
```

Please see the [Cosmos Tokenizer README within the NeMo repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/nemo/collections/common/video_tokenizers) for additional examples to create training datasets with Cosmos Tokenizer.

    * Reconstruction Fréchet Inception Distance (rFID)

## Runtime Comparison

The following table shows the number of parameters and the averaged encoding and decoding times per image or video frame, measured on a single A100 80GB GPU. For comparison, we also list the parameters and average speeds of prior state-of-the-art tokenizer(s) with the same compression ratio.

| Tokenizer            | Resolution | Compression Ratio | Parameters | Time (ms) |
|----------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| LlamaGen             | 1024x1024  | 8×8              | 70M        | 475       |
| Cosmos-Tokenizer-DI  | 1024x1024  | 8×8              | 79M        | **64.2**  |


Note: We benchmarked the runtime for images under the 8x8 compression and videos under the 4×8×8 compression. Tokenizers with different compression ratios are not included in this comparison.
