"""Second-pass filter on top of select_sports_subset.py's sports_subset_video_ids.txt:
excludes videos whose video_summary explicitly flags animated/cartoon content.

Motivation (found while investigating the 2 lowest-yield videos in the 24-video
Phase 1 pilot, job 976467): select_sports_subset.py's keyword match ("dancing",
"running", etc.) fires on generic verbs regardless of context, so it lets through
some animated content (a review video mentioning "a clip of a dancing Robot", a
fairy-tale cartoon short with characters "running away"). Worse than the obvious
zero-detection case: one pilot video (Ncl93lkMpJM, an animated music video about
cartoon dinosaur characters per its own video_summary) still got 56.3% frame-level
HRNet "person" detection -- Faster-RCNN/HRNet can false-positive on stylized
anthropomorphic characters, producing keypoints with real-human confidence scores
but no real-human body proportions. MotionBERT (trained on Human3.6M, real humans
only) lifting those would produce silently wrong 3D pose, not just missing data --
worse for training than a clean skip.

This filter is intentionally narrow (matches only when the source's own summary
says the content IS animated/cartoon/CGI) and will NOT catch every animated video
-- e.g. character-driven fairy-tale content whose summary just uses character
names ("Redhead Girl", "Peter Pan Boy") without ever saying "animated" won't
match. Frame-level detection-rate stats from the real Phase 1 run remain the
final backstop for whatever this text heuristic misses.
